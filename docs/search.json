Plotting function shows intention condition. assign daily precipitation sums lower 0 mm weight (almost) 1. Yet, precipitation sums 2 mm still probability 0.88 4 mm 0.34. Daily precipitation sums larger 7 mm receive weight (almost) 0. condition makes scheduling operations days exceed certain precipitation less likely. Fig. 6: Example using w_log() assign lower weights days higher precipitation. can now combine 3 conditions use combination scheduling plant operation. compare time series precipitation weights based precipitation can see days without precipitation get weight 1 rainy days weight lower one. red bars show combined weights days. can see conditions md define time window April 27 May 7. time window dates excluded lower weight depending precipitation dates. operation scheduling algorithm selects date operation weighted random sampling. Thus dates weight > 0 can selected. Dates larger weights however likely selected dates smaller weights.
